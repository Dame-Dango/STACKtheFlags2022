# Finding Nyan

## Description

> Jaga visits a software development company that uses a custom CI/CD system to build executables for their software every 1 minute. While CI/CD is a good practice in the industry, just like other companies in this world of vulnerabilities, the system administrators forgot to close a guest account on the build system. Rumour has it that the login details for this account can be found easily in one of the provided files. Luckily, this account does not have root access and cannot access the confidential information stored in the root directory...or can it?
